# How to install Java and IDE on your computer
### Note: This only works for Mac Computer
## Step 1: Opening Terminal
- Go to your list of applications and you should find one called terminal. Click on it.
## Step 2: Installing Git
- Type in 
```
git --version
```
-If you don't have git, it should prompt you to install it.
## Step 3: Installing Java
- Type into your terminal
```
java -version
```
- If you don't have Java installed, a pop-up should appear, telling you to click "More Info..." to download it.
- Click on the link and it should lead you to the oracle website
- Under the JDK section, download the right one for the mac
- After it has finished installing, go back to your terminal to see if it has properly installed. If both of these commands work, then you have successfully installed Java on your computer. 
``` 
java
javac
```
- Then we are done!
## Step 3: Installing the IDE
- The preferred IDE we will be using is VSCode since it is simple and easy to learn.
- Go to this [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and click download based on your operating system.
- After you are done, also pin it to your taskbar. 

## Step 4: Opening the Terminal
- Once VSCode is open, you can press ```ctrl + ` ``` to open the terminal.  
- Follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/rhanclass/GettingStarted/blob/master/TerminalCommands.md) if you want to familiarize yourself with how to nagivate terminal. (Note that this will probably be useful in the future)
